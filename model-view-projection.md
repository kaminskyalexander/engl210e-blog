title: Model View Projection Matrix
---

<!-- Something about the idea of transforming space around the camera instead of transforming how the camera works. The camera is always located at (0, 0) -->

<!-- Explain that here we use 2D for simplicity, but that this approach works just as well for 3D -->

# Brief introduction to matrices

<!-- Talk about what basis vectors are. Talk about how matrix determines where basis vectors end up. -->

# Model matrix

# View matrix

# Projection matrix

# Putting it together

<!-- Recall that multiplying matrices "combines" these transformations of space. So we multiply Model View Projection matrices  -->
